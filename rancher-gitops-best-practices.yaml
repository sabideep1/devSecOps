#Rancher
local: upstream cluster
webhook, cattle-system
Downstream cluster: all other cluster added thru portal


#gitOps#################
Infrastructure as Code Done Right.
Policy as CODE
Network as CODE
Security as CODE
Configuration as CODE

Issues:
- No Pull Requests [Merge Requests]
- No CODE Reviews
- No Collaboration
- No Automated Tests

Application: Once the code is completed
- Kubectl apply 
- terraform apply from the local system
- ALl the users need proper permission to infrastructure
- This can cause issue with security
- Hard to trace who executed
- Will know only when the infrastructure breaks

Still implementation is ineffecient and manaul

With GitOPs: when you push it to main branch
- IAC code is stored in github
- Create Pull/Merge Requests and collaborate
- RUN CI pipeline to validate and run automated tests
- Once tested, Review and Approve Changes
- RUN CD Pipeline to apply chanegs
- Automated and Transparent Process

CD pipeline:
- In gitops there are 2 ways of deployment
- Push Deployment: Jenkins, CI/CD 
- Pull Deployment: 
  - Agent is installed in the environment
  - Monitors and Compares the desired state
  - Applies the changes necessary to get to desired state
  eg. fluxCD and ArgoCD

- Easy Rollback
- git rever to undo the changes to get the env to last working state
