Git Flow work FLow
1. Main Branch: Master
2. Create Dev Branch from Master
3. Create Feature branch out of Dev branch
3. Once the F1/feature is completed merge it to Dev Branch
4. If F2 branch is created before F1 is merged, 
    - then changes in dev branch after F1 is merged should be merged to F2 branch

The overall flow of Gitflow is:

A develop branch is created from main
Feature branches are created from develop
When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch

A release branch is created from develop
When the release branch is done it is merged into  main branch and tagged with version
Release branch is also merged to develop branch
If an issue in main is detected a hotfix branch is created from main
Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and main
