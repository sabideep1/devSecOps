FALCO: Kubernetes threat detection engine
Benefits:
  - Strengthen container security
  - Reduce risk via immediate alerts
  - Leverage most current detection rules


Falco needs to know what syscalls are coming from Application in User Space to kernel space
Falco interact with kernel with eBPF
The syscalls are then analyed by sysdig libraries in user space
The events are then filtered by predefined rules and policies

Falco rules:
  rules.yaml: 
    - rule: define rule
    - list: add items to include
    - macros: define condition variable
