Code: focus on secret managment
Build: Code Quality SAST [Static Application Securirty Testing ]
Test: Run Quality DAST [Dynamic Application Security Testing]

Operate: Hardening
CI server: Bug Tracking and Metrics Dashboard
SonarQube:
Image Scanning for vulnerabilites:

Security risks:
- vulnerable/outdated 3rd party libraries are used
- Licensing issues
- Sensitive/Password is hardwccoded
- Vulnerable Docker base image is used
- kubernetes is misconfigured
Security team will run tests and may find above issues
Security checks/audits can delay the process
With microservices, 
it exposes API for each service that means more attack surface
microservice: more attack surface
containers: more attack surface
Cloud Platform: more attack surface
Kubernetes:  more attack surface
