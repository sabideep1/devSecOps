Image Scanning for vulnerabilites:

Security risks:
- vulnerable/outdated 3rd party libraries are used
- Licensing issues
- Sensitive/Password is hardwccoded

- kubernetes is misconfigured
Security team will run tests and may find above issues
Security checks/audits can delay the process

containers: more attack surface
Cloud Platform: more attack surface
Kubernetes:  more attack surface

Think about security at the beginning and fix the issue right way
