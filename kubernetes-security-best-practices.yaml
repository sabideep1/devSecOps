CertManager: 
-  To Auto generate CSR, Isused and Generate Certificate before the 30 days of expiry.

OpaGatekeeper: Policy and Governance for Kubernetes [rego language ]
- Once the user is authenticated, OPA comes into picture which has policy defined with authorization
- You deploy OPA in the environment, configure the policy and all services will reach out to OPA for 
   authorizing the request OPA will verify the request and rewturn allow or deny response
- Enforce policies on what users can or cannot do in the cluster
OPA in Kubernetes: This will work as admission controller for validating and mutating webhook
- Create Validatingwebhook
- Webhook will send request to OPA endpoint 
- OPA will check the policy and returns allow or deny based on the policy
- Examples: trusted registry, ingress Host, wildcard certificates
- Kube-mgmt service is deployed as sidecard container along with OPA and 
 - create configmap Resource with label openpolicy and add OPA policy in configmap data
- kube-mgmt service is used to replicate kubernetes resources to OPA
- kube-mgmt service is used to load policies into OPA via kubernetes
All the requests will go thru admission controller through validating webhook to OPA
