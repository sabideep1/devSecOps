CD workflow without Argo CD:
  challenges:
  - Build Automation tools should be installed with kubectl, helm 
  - Jenkins needs access to k8s
  - Jenkins need access to Cloud Provider [NSG]
  - Security Challenges
  - With many projects and clusters, difficult to track
  - No visibility once the CD is triggered
  - CD part can be Improved

How Argo CD works: It is built for k8s with gitops approch
- Argo CD is part of the cluster
- Argo CD agent pulls manifest changes and applies them
- Argo CD is track the git repo and look for the changes

How it works?
- Jenkins will Build the image and push the image to registry
- Update the deployment.yaml with Image tag and update other yaml files
- Push it to the git repo where Argo CD is tracking
- Separate repo for app source code and k8s manifest yaml file
- Even separate repo for configuration management code
